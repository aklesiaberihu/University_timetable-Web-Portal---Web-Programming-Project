The web-based University Schedule Management System functions as a tool to make university schedule management simpler. The system features both an administrator dashboard to control courses and rooms while creating timetables plus a student portal to display personal class schedules. The administrative dashboard lets users handle resources effectively which produces schedules that avoid clashes and are correct. The system presents each student's schedule through a simple interface that matches what they are taking.
The system operates through PHP backend functions with MySQL database management and presents user content using HTML CSS and JavaScript. The platform solves room conflicts and course overlaps while providing a secure and expandable system for university scheduling needs. With user authentication the system safeguards personal information and gives access permission based on user roles. The system proves how we can boost both university staff productivity and student satisfaction through design.
